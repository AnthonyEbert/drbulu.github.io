Introducing Dr Jekyll...

## Intro
In the first blog post series, [**Setup Us the BLOG**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-11-04-setup-us-the-blog-part1-preamble %}), I gave an overview of why I chose to use the Jekyll website generation framework and how I setup the foundation of this site. Therefore, Jekyll is the next obvious tool to master, and this post is a culmination of my initial attempt to come to grips with the features of this framework, to enable me to make the best use of to generate good content.

Incidentally, I have also taken to using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as my Markdown IDE, since it handles the task quite well and has good overall features.

## Jekyll
As I have been setting up this blog and adding blog content, I have found myself looking up the [docs](http://jekyllrb.com/) to make it easier and more efficient to create content. 

There is a lot of rich content in these pages, much of which I won't need to use frequently.

[creating site pages](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/), [using variables](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/) and [cross-referencing posts](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#post_url).

more advanced content that I expect to regularly use are [templates](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/), [permalinks](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) and [pagination](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/).

## Liquid
Jekyll makes use of [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), which is basically a Ruby-based [templating language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_processor). Essentially, Jekyll uses Liquid to "auto fill" or "auto complete" different parts of the website into a coherent, well formatted, whole in a way that eliminates as much repetitive manual labour as possible.

Example: The series

## Conclusion
This post isn't an exhaustive look into these subjects, so much as a useful primer to familiarise myself with the useful properties of these tools that I will make must use of.
