[Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) is build upon the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) platform, which itself is built (coded) in [Go](https://golang.org/).

Based on the Github [contributor analysis](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/graphs/contributors) of this project, [yihui](https://github.com/yihui) is the primary contributor to Blogdown (as at Feb 2017) 

blog post [here](http://kevinfw.com/post/blogging-with-r-markdown/) in Dec 2016 indicated that blogdown is still in dev. Which makes sense given that Blogdown is not yet featured at RStudio.

As it typical, Hugo has a [quickstart](http://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart) as well as a Hugo has a section oMigrating from [Jekyll](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/migrate-from-jekyll/)
