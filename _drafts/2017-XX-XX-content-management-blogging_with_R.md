However, a simpler path was posted by [Adam Duncan](https://www.r-bloggers.com/creating-jekyll-blog-posts-from-r/) to R-bloggers (originally [here](gtog.github.io/workflow/2013/06/12/rmarkdown-to-rbloggers/)).


Andy South has an interesting [blog setup](http://andysouth.github.io/blog-setup/) where Rmarkdown files are converted to Jekylly-friendly markdown format using code in the [rmd2md.R](https://github.com/AndySouth/andysouth.github.io/blob/master/rmd2md.r) file.

## Blogdown

[Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) is build upon the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) platform, which itself is built (coded) in [Go](https://golang.org/).

Based on the Github [contributor analysis](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/graphs/contributors) of this project, [yihui](https://github.com/yihui) is the primary contributor to Blogdown (as at Feb 2017) 

blog post [here](http://kevinfw.com/post/blogging-with-r-markdown/) in Dec 2016 indicated that blogdown is still in dev. Which makes sense given that Blogdown is not yet featured at RStudio.

As it typical, Hugo has a [quickstart](http://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart) as well as a Hugo has a section oMigrating from [Jekyll](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/migrate-from-jekyll/)
