From manifesto to toolkit!

## Intro
The previous post covered the principles that I hope to govern the content that I put up on this site. Now that this ground work has been laid out, the next logical step for me was to gather together some of the basic tools that I will need to rely upon in order to effectively produce said content.

## RMarkdown Options


Note: Not comfortable with slaving my website development to RStudio... for one, it loads more slowly that gedit, my beloved text editor :), I know that Vim and Emacs are lovely, but one must conquer the world one text editor at a time.


Note from part 1: Getting RMarkdown to work with Jekyll is going to be quite important for me, as many of the topic and project pages that I intend to create.

Misc: **http://www.webaxe.org/** have a nice content layout, albeit a bit cluttered, however the tag cloud is a useful thing to try to implement. Good to remember when continuing content 

not Jekyll compatible though :frown: the .nojekyll file was a deal breaker
