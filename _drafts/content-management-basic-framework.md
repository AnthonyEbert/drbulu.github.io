Content curation

1) Type and purpose of content
blog posts- single and series - freeform exploration of various topics in small chunks. can connect via series
topic pages - wiki-style content pages that consolidate knowledge gained by i) generating blog content ii) revision of content gained from formal (i.e. structured) study of content
project pages - the application of concepts belonging to one or more topic areas of study to the solution of a reasonalby complex problem

blogs: topical activity
    capture new idea snippets - evolving and dynamic
    feeds into topic pages
topic pages/study notes: foundational topic pages that codify my learning and help me to organise different concepts together around a common theme
    condilidate topical information
    a) discussed in blog posts or series
    b) learnt through formal / informal channels
    distills them into essentially "timeless" / static information. Can be updated like a wiki but very focused and structured
    serves as a major springboard for further learning
    ideas feed back into blog content or onto projects
project = application of what I know
    furhter consolidation of concepts that are aquired and consolidated in posts and study notes
    practical manifestations aiming to i) complete understanding of on/more cincepts ii) link concepts together practically to solve problems
    iii) help me to continue to enjoy and explore the ideas that I have learned and reinforced, making them second nature.




These stages represent incremental consolidation of information.

2) Examples of main topics ?

3) Basic content organisation components - research docs
categories - main topic areas 
tags - subtopics

Ideally: a post/page should be linked to ONE main topic (category), but can possibly be linked to content in other subtopic (tags).. not sure how well this will hold, but the clear intent is to encourage myself to judiciously organise content.

Something that has ONE origin (category) can have multiple contexts (?)

If one item has too many categories, this indicates poor content clasification.

Proper classification is a prerequisite for effective learning, it is essential for effective linking and blending of ideas.

The fuss?
"He who fails to prepare, prepares to fail"

proverb with pallindromic structure?

Also means that categories should be broad enough to catch logically related ideas, without encompassing ones that do not fit the theme, classical classification problem (link)

(important) Need to work on a consistent and standard set of categories (very much so) and tags (more flexibility) as these will be used to organise ALL of my content going forward.

Note: this is partially subjective, some classifications being universally obvious, but will be designed to expedite and reinforce my learning goals and process!

A systematic process will help me to realise where to put new content, and when to add new topic categories or subtopic tags

you can even have 3 levels if you want to: main category, subcategory, tags (might be more useful and less restrictive)
main category: mandatory classification, with optional heirarchical organisation of other category layers :)

In summary:  
If you want posts that are related to one subject area, you search by category  
If you want posts that are linked to one or more activities across different subject areas, you search by tags  
this should clarify the intent.
