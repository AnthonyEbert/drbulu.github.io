Why do this? - Data Science projects

* for the love of data!
* Cement data science skills that I learn from formal and informal sources
    * Learned a range of data science skills at coursera (biopage link)
        * I keep encountering them as I go
        * Need to laster them, through practice
* Need to expand skill set
    * consistent with strategy of "formal" and "informal" methods
    * learn new things asyou go
* Build a data science portfolio
    * strengthen organised skills development
    * CV support: allow me to develop a data science oriented CV based on independent, (open source, open data) projects.
    
* Basic types:
    * independent: typically github: code + docs + data projects (e.g. Shiny and D3)
    * Competitions: e.g. Kaggle
    * Possibly other options.
    
* Organisation
    * Main project page with an intro:
        * linked to this intro post
        * links out the individual project pages
        * serves as a glossary/directory/index 
    * Project pages:
        * Title
        * Brief project description (Abstract)
        * links:
            * github source
            * derivative data products
            * related blog posts
            * related external references. e.g.
