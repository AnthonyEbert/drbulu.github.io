Premeditation - love to brood before taking action.

african proverb

I aim to make the best use of my limited, valuable time in this life, so that I may bless (empower to prosper) others around me as I am more empowered by knowledge, insight, and the wisdom to effectively make use of my talent. It is my earnest hope that I may continue to prosper from the experiences of this process, and to enjoy the insights, great and small, that I acquire along the way.
