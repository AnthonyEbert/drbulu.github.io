# README - drbulu's website

This is the github repo for my [personal website](drbulu.github.io), which is based on the excellent [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/blob/master/README.md) template and hosted on [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

More about me at [drbulu.github.io/drbio](https://drbulu.github.io/drbio/).
