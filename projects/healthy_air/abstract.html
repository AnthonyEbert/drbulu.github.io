This is a project that aims to explore respiratory health, focusing on asthma, in the context of potential factors that may explain how it changes over time. Specifically, I am interested in how the prevalence and severity of asthma are potentially affected by factors such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>pollution sources and emmission types</li>
    <li>demographic characteristics</li>
    <li>meterological factors</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is an end to end project, whcih basically means that the scope of this project covers the entire data science process, which includes important activities like: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data wrangling: Raw data acquisition, processing and management</li>
    <li>Data exploration and feature selection</li>
    <li>Data modelling and statistical inference</li>
    <li>Predictive analytics via machine learning and/or data modelling to leverage significant patterns and trends identified within the datasets</li>
    <li>Creation of Data Products: reproducible reports and data visualisations</li>
</ul>
