## Introduction

<p style="text-align:justify;">Welcome to my data science projects page! As part of my ongoing growth as a data scientist, an important component is practice. Specifically, my projects are aimed at asking intersting questions of real open datasets in order to derive, visualise and present potentially useful insights and possible solutions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">An important feature of this section of the site is that it enables me to explore a variety of interesting and useful data science techniques and apply them to realistic scenarios. Please checkout <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-03-02-data_sci-proj-strategy %}">this overview post</a> if you want a bit more background. Otherwise, please feel free to browse the index below that summarises my growing list of projects to get a feel for what I have been exploring to date.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Thanks for stopping by... I hope that you will find inspiration and enjoyment here :smile:!</p>
