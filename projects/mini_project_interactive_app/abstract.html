This mini-project was an assignment for the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products">Developing Data Products</a> MOOC on Coursera. The aim of this project was to create a complex and useful interactive Shiny app to illustrate the fundamental principles in the assessment of regression models using a simple dataset. The inspiration for this project was drawn from the concepts that I was studying in the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models">Regression Models</a> MOOC that I had taken not long before that.
